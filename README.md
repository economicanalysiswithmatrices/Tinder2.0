# Tinder2.0

We have created Tinder 2.0 with the aim of matching potential partners with better precision than the current application. Users will be asked to fill out a questionnaire to determine their preferred characteristics in a potential suiter, before seeing any possible matches. This then pre-scans all other Tinder 2.0 members, and only shows those who match the users list of preferred characteristics. Members will also be asked to fill out their own details/ characteristics, so the potential matches the view will also like them back. Users will be given multiple suiters, in which they could choose from.

Percentage split:
